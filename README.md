# Splice Wallet Kernel

## Project

### Short Description 

Splice Wallet Kernel is a javascript & typescript based library that help facilitate communication between a Validator node, a canton developed dApp and a Keystore.

### Dependent Projects

Splice Wallet Kernel is part of the Splice Ecosystem, that have grown out of the Daml blockchain ecosystem and its Canton protocol.

### Motivation

Splice Wallet Kernel aims to enable a transparent interaction between a dApp, Validator Node and a Keystore. On public permissionless blockchains, a total state is shared amongst all nodes and as such, once a public key is shared the given counter party has full knowledge of your holdings, transactions history etc. Canton's unique approach to security and privacy result in fractured states shared amongst selected Validator nodes, and as such simply showing ownership of the associated private key does not present your entire financial data to a counter-party (in this example a dApp).

Spice Wallet Kernel aims to:
 - Maintain the high-level of security and trust that lies in the Canton Protocol.
 - Enable seamless communication between a dApp, Validator Node and Signature Provider, similar in experience to other blockchains.
 - Provide transparency against malicious dApps, Validator Nodes or Signature Providers.
 - Create a standardized communication framework, that allows anybody to extend or integrate with the Wallet Kernel.

### Status

The project is currently (2nd of June, 2025) in its infancy.
