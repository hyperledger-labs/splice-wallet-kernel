# canton

This directory contains configuration for a local Canton setup. It starts a participant, a mediator, and a sequencer with persistent identities. That ensures that each node has the same cryptographic namespace/fingerprints across restarts.

## Usage

To run the Canton setup yourself, follow the steps from the [canton](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/splice-wallet-kernel/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#canton) section of the CONTRIBUTING.md guide.
