# DApp SDK

This SDK is for 3rd-party dApps developed against the Canton Network. It's intended to be used in a browser to securely connect users to Canton Network wallets. Once connected, the SDK provides a dApp UI permissions to read a user's selected Canton party and request transaction signatures.

The dApp SDK aims to adopt or follow Ethereum development conventions where possible, for example [eip-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193).
