Hosting a Validator
===================

For hosting a validator we recommend reading the splice documetation on: https://docs.dev.sync.global/index.html

The Wallet integration guide is tailored to work with localnet setup (https://docs.dev.sync.global/app_dev/testing/localnet.html)
to make testing and verfication easy.
