Supporting Tokens and Applications
==================================

To integrate and support tokens it is recommended to use the splice documentation on this: https://docs.dev.sync.global/app_dev/token_standard/index.html

If you are interested in building your own application, a good first place would be to utilize the CN quickstart: https://github.com/digital-asset/cn-quickstart
