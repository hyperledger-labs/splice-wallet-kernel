Exchange Integration Guide
==========================

The pages below guide you how to integrate an exchange with Canton
for the purpose of trading Canton Network Token Standard compliant tokens like Canton Coin.

The core of such an integration is automating the deposits and withdrawals
of tokens to and from the exchange. The guide can thus also be used for services other
than exchanges that want to support deposits and withdrawals of Canton Network tokens.
