# Contribution Guidelines

## Setup

### git "signed-off-by" commit

As a requirement under the hyperledger foundation, all commits must be signed off. This can be done by adding the `-s` flag every time you commit.

Run `npm run update-hooks` which will install a git hook to automatically set this for you.

It is also recommended (but not required) to add a gpg key: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account
