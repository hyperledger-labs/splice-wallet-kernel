API Reference
=============

The dApp SDK implements the **dApp API** as defined in `CIP-0103 <https://github.com/canton-foundation/cips/blob/main/cip-0103/cip-0103.md>`_. The API provides a standardized, transport-agnostic interface that enables decentralized applications (dApps) to securely interact with the Canton Network via Wallets.

The dApp API exists in two variants, each targeting a different deployment model and interaction pattern.

OpenRPC Specifications
----------------------

The machine-readable API specifications are maintained in the repository:

- **Sync API**: `openrpc-dapp-api.json <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/splice-wallet-kernel/blob/main/api-specs/openrpc-dapp-api.json>`_
- **Async API**: `openrpc-dapp-remote-api.json <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/splice-wallet-kernel/blob/main/api-specs/openrpc-dapp-remote-api.json>`_

Synchronous dApp API (Sync API)
-------------------------------

The **Synchronous dApp API** is intended for clients that have direct access to a Wallet, such as browser extensions or desktop applications.
In this model, methods and events are executed in a standard request-response fashion, allowing dApps to perform ledger reads, transaction preparation, and signing operations immediately.

This variant is the canonical choice for end-user applications, providing a familiar synchronous programming model and minimizing latency between user actions and dApp responses.

**Methods:**

   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Method
     - Output
     - Description
   * - ``connect``
     - ConnectResult
     - Establishes a connection to the Wallet
   * - ``disconnect``
     - void
     - Closes the session between the client and the provider
   * - ``isConnected``
     - ConnectResult
     - Indicates connectivity to the Wallet
   * - ``status``
     - StatusEvent
     - Contains information regarding the connected Wallet and Network
   * - ``getActiveNetwork``
     - Network
     - Details of the connected network
   * - ``listAccounts``
     - Account[]
     - Lists all accounts the user has access to
   * - ``getPrimaryAccount``
     - Account
     - Returns the single account set as primary
   * - ``signMessage``
     - string
     - Signs an arbitrary string message
   * - ``prepareExecute``
     - void
     - Prepares, signs, and executes Daml commands
   * - ``ledgerApi``
     - string
     - Proxies requests to the JSON Ledger API

**Events:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Event
     - Payload
     - Description
   * - ``accountsChanged``
     - AccountsChangedEvent
     - Emitted when accounts change; contains all accounts and indicates the primary account
   * - ``statusChanged``
     - StatusEvent
     - Emitted when provider status changes (authentication, network connectivity)
   * - ``txChanged``
     - TxChangedEvent
     - Announces changes to the lifecycle of initiated transactions

Asynchronous dApp API (Async API)
---------------------------------

The **Asynchronous dApp API** is designed for server-side Wallets or Wallets deployed as remote services, where synchronous interactions are not feasible due to transport limitations (e.g., HTTP request timeouts) or the need for multi-step user authorization.

This variant mirrors the Sync API but decomposes operations that require user interaction into multi-phase workflows. For such operations, the API returns a ``userUrl`` that directs the user to complete the required action (e.g., login or transaction approval), and emits the corresponding event once the action is finalized.

**Key Differences from Sync API:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 50

   * - Method
     - Output
     - Difference
   * - ``connect``
     - { ...ConnectResult, userUrl: string }
     - If no prior connection exists, returns a ``userUrl`` pointing to a login facility. After successful login, a ``connected`` event is emitted.
   * - ``prepareExecute``
     - { userUrl: string }
     - Returns a ``userUrl`` pointing to a review facility where the user can approve or decline signing. A ``txChanged`` event is emitted after the prepare phase completes.

**Additional Event:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Event
     - Payload
     - Description
   * - ``connected``
     - StatusEvent
     - Same payload as ``statusChanged`` but only emitted as part of the login flow

Choosing Between Sync and Async API
-----------------------------------

+---------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Consideration             | Sync API                          | Async API                         |
+===========================+===================================+===================================+
| **Deployment Model**      | Client-side (browser extension,   | Server-side, remote custody       |
|                           | desktop)                          | services                          |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **User Interaction**      | Direct, real-time                 | Via ``userUrl`` redirects         |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Blocking Calls**        | Supported                         | Not supported                     |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Transport**             | postMessage, in-app bridges       | HTTPS, SSE                        |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Clients such as frontends that work against the Sync API **should** also work against a server exposing the Async API. The dApp SDK provides this compatibility by implementing the Sync API interface while relaying calls to an Async API server internally.

Provider Interface
------------------

Both API variants are accessed through a **Provider** interface, following the pattern established by `EIP-1193 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193>`_:

.. code-block:: typescript

    interface Provider {
        request<T>(args: { method: string; params?: unknown[] | Record<string, unknown> }): Promise<T>
        on<T>(event: string, listener: (...args: T[]) => void): Provider
        emit<T>(event: string, ...args: T[]): boolean
        removeListener<T>(event: string, listener: (...args: T[]) => void): Provider
    }

Error Codes
-----------

The dApp API adopts standardized error codes from `EIP-1193 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193>`_ and `EIP-1474 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1474>`_:
