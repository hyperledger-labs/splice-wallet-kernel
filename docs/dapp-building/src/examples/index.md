# Examples

The following example dApps demonstrate how to use the dApp SDK and Wallet Gateway.
You can find them in the [`/examples`](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/splice-wallet-kernel/tree/main/examples) directory of the repository.

## Ping

A minimal example dApp that imports the dApp SDK and communicates with a Wallet Gateway.
Built with React + TypeScript using the Vite template, this is the best starting point for understanding the basics of dApp SDK integration.

**Running:**

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Portfolio

**Building and running:**

Because this example has a number of dependencies, it is recommended to use the scripts in the root repository for development:

```bash
yarn build:all
yarn start:all   # this service lives at http://localhost:8081
yarn stop:all
```
