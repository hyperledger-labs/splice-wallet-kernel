# dApp Building

Build decentralized applications (dApps) that interact with the **Canton Network** through the **Wallet Gateway**. Use the **dApp SDK** in your frontend to connect users to their wallets, and the Wallet Gateway to mediate between your dApp, Canton validator nodes, and signing providers.
