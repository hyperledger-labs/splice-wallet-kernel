# Release

This repository is a monorepo of independently versioned Javascript packages. We use Conventional Commits to track changes to individual packages over time. When it comes time to publish updates to NPM, a maintainer runs through the following process:

1. Checkout `main` and `git pull` to be up-to-date
2. Run `yarn release` from the repo root (depends on `gh` CLI to open a PR)
3. Merge the version bump PR into `main`
4. Open and merge a PR from `main` to `latest`
5. Wait for the `publish.yml` workflow to complete on `latest`. Afterwards, any updated packages should be pushed to NPM

## Backporting

It may be required to backport a fix to a previous major version of an SDK or package. Suppose we have latest stable of `wallet-sdk` at v2.x.y, but we need to apply an emergency fix to `wallet-sdk` v1. Because every release is tagged in git, this should be straightforward:

1. `git checkout @canton-network/wallet-sdk@1.x.y`
2. `git checkout -b backport/wallet-sdk/v1`
    - create a long-running backport branch, which we can continuously add fixes to over some LTS period, if necessary
    - from then on, we can just checkout the branch instead of the tag
3. Apply changes (`git apply ...` or etc)
4. Run a new release against the branch to trigger a minor/patch version bump
5. Open a PR, merge back into branch and wait for CI to publish
